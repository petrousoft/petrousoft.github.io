My passion lies in **designing and implementing robust cloud environments, prioritizing reliability, developer productivity, and cost optimization**. I also tackle complex **DevOps challenges, ensuring seamless delivery and automation**.

Beyond infrastructure, I'm actively expanding my expertise in **backend development with `FastAPI`**.

Explore my work below to see how I bring these skills to life.

### 1. Basic Book Management API (books_v1)

This project served as my foundational exploration into **FastAPI**, demonstrating basic API design principles and data handling for a simple book management system. It showcases initial setup and fundamental CRUD operations.

* **API Demo:** [View Project](http://books_v1.petrousoft.com/docs)
* **Code:** [repo](https://github.com/gpetrousov/tachydev/tree/main/books_v1)
* **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI

---

### 2. Enhanced Book Management API (books_v2)

An improved iteration of the initial book management system, focusing on more robust data validation and type hinting with **Pydantic** and **Python's Typing** module. This version refines API endpoints and demonstrates cleaner code structure.

* **API Demo:** [View Project](http://books_v2.petrousoft.com/docs)
* **Code:** [repo](https://github.com/gpetrousov/tachydev/tree/main/books_v2)
* **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typing

---

### 3. OAuth2 & API Protection (Authentication Module)

A concise implementation demonstrating the **OAuth2 protocol** for user authentication and robust **API endpoint protection** using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This project is key for understanding secure access control in web services.

* **API Demo:** [View Project](http://authentication.petrousoft.com/docs)
* **Code:** [repo](https://github.com/gpetrousov/tachydev/tree/main/authentication)
* **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typing, JWT, passlib

---

### 4. Comprehensive User Management System (Userman)

A complete solution for user management, encompassing user registration, secure **OAuth2 authentication**, and API protection with **JWT**. This system provides a full-stack authentication backbone for applications.

* **API Demo:** [View Project](http://userman.petrousoft.com/docs)
* **Code:** [repo](https://github.com/gpetrousov/tachydev/tree/main/user_management)
* **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typing, JWT, passlib

---

### 5. Task Management API with SQLAlchemy (Todos)

This project implements **CRUD operations for a task management system**, leveraging **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM and **SQLite** for the database. It demonstrates effective database integration within a FastAPI application.

* **API Demo:** [View Project](http://todos.petrousoft.com/docs)
* **Code:** [repo](https://github.com/gpetrousov/tachydev/tree/main/todos)
* **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typing, SQLAlchemy,

---

### 6. Movies API with Routers & SQLAlchemy

An implementation showcasing **CRUD operations for movie management**, designed with FastAPI's **router system** for modularity and maintainability. It integrates **SQLAlchemy** for database interactions and includes **OAuth2** for secure access.

* **API Demo:** [View Project](http://movies.petrousoft.com/docs)
* **Code:** [repo](https://github.com/gpetrousov/tachydev/tree/main/movies)
* **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, OAuth2, Typing, SQLAlchemy,
